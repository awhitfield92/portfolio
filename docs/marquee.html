      <h1 class="marquee-title">Project Marquee: Modernizing a Legacy SaaS Platform</h1>
      <div class="marquee-meta">Wellcom Internal Project &middot; Ongoing</div>
      <div class="marquee-content">
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This was one of my largest and most complex projects: redesigning and modernizing the user interface of a legacy SaaS application to improve usability, address long-standing pain points, and align the product with current user expectations.</p>
        <p>Through extensive user research, journey mapping, wireframing, and iterative testing, we delivered a refreshed experience that reduced friction and improved user satisfaction.</p>
        
        <h2>Discovery &amp; Research</h2>
        <p>The project began with extensive user research to identify friction points and usability issues within the legacy platform. I conducted user interviews, gathered feedback from existing customers, and collaborated with internal support teams to collect recurring pain points and feature requests.</p>
        <p>Key findings revealed that users struggled with the complexity of the interface, found it difficult to navigate, and often felt overwhelmed by the amount of information presented. The legacy design was cluttered, inconsistent, and did not align with modern usability standards.</p>
        
        <div class="quote-row">
          <div class="sticky-quote sticky-quote-tilt-up">
            “Why are there so many menus”
          </div>
          <div class="sticky-quote sticky-quote-tilt-down">
            “It feels clunky and old”
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="quote-center">
          <div class="sticky-quote">
            “It's too complex”
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Journey Mapping & Workflow Analysis</h2>
        <p>I mapped the existing user flows and pinpointed where inefficiencies existed. This clarified where time was being lost and where users were confused or frustrated.</p>
        <p>This application does a lot. It requires users to navigate through multiple layers of information and functionality, which can be overwhelming. There were menus that users never touched. Didn't even know what they were.</p>
        
        <h2>Collaborative Ideation & Design Exploration</h2>
        <p>Working closely with stakeholders, product managers, developers, and different user groups, we collaboratively defined project goals and prioritised features. I facilitated design workshops to align on new interaction patterns that would modernize the interface while preserving core functionality for existing users.</p>
        <p>Through research, I came up with the statement of</p>
        <div class="hmw-speech">
          How might we modernize the legacy SaaS interface to improve usability without disrupting existing workflows?
        </div>

        <h2>Low-Fidelity Prototyping & IA</h2>
        <p>I developed wireframes to explore updated layouts, navigation structures, and content hierarchies that better reflected users’ mental models. Particular focus was placed on improving task efficiency, reducing unnecessary complexity, and ensuring consistency across complex workflows.</p>

        <h2>High-Fidelity UI Design</h2>
        <p>With validated wireframes, I started producing high-fidelity UI designs in Adobe XD that brought a modern, clean aesthetic to the platform, improving both usability and visual appeal. Interactive prototypes were created to simulate key workflows and support developer handoff.</p>

        <h2>Cross-Functional Collaboration</h2>
        <p>Throughout the project, I maintained close collaboration with developers to ensure technical feasibility and accurate implementation of design components. Regular reviews with stakeholders and user representatives ensured alignment across business and user needs.</p>

        <h2>User Testing & Iteration</h2>
        <p>Usability testing sessions were conducted during the design process. Low-fidelity prototypes were tested in internal teams to capture user feedback. This feedback loop informed multiple iterations, refining the interface to ensure the redesign addressed actual user pain points and improved task success rates.</p>

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>This is still an ongoing project. I am hoping that the redesigned SaaS platform successfully modernized the user experience, reduced user frustration, improved task efficiency, and positioned the product for future scalability — all while retaining familiarity for long-standing users transitioning from the legacy system.
          When showcasing these designs to stakeholders, I received positive feedback on the improved usability and modern aesthetic. The clients were very excited about the potential of the new interface and were eager to see it implemented.
