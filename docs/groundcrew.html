      <div class="marquee-meta">Wellcom Internal Project</div>
      <div class="marquee-content">
        <p>
          <strong>Role:</strong> UX/UI Designer (end-to-end), Developer (front-end)<br>
          <strong>Tools:</strong> Figma, AI-assisted research synthesis, React Native
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Overview:</strong> I designed a mobile application that enables our in-house team to quickly scan product swing tags. The app captures a photo of the swing tag, extracts the barcode number via image-to-text recognition, and allows users to complete a digital form. This data is then seamlessly transferred into a connected web application.
        </p>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>We needed a way to record product swing tags more efficiently. Manual entry of barcode numbers often led to mistakes, incomplete product information, and additional time spent transferring data into the web system. The goal of this project was to create a mobile-first solution that reduced manual entry, streamlined the workflow, and ensured that product data was accurate and complete.</p>

        <h2>Research & Insights</h2>
        <p>To address this challenge, I conducted user interviews and usability testing with the in-house team to understand where the pain points occurred in the current process. I then used AI tools to consolidate notes and identify key patterns. This research revealed that users wanted a quick and reliable way to capture product information. Understanding these pain points allowed me to focus the design on accuracy, efficiency, and clarity.</p>

        <h2>User Personas & Journey</h2>
        <p>We needed to understand who our users were and how they interacted with the current workflow. I created personas to represent typical users, such as Carol, a Sample Coordinator who needed to quickly scan and record product information during busy stock intake. By mapping Carol’s journey, I identified key pain points, including areas where required information was missed, and opportunities to streamline the workflow from scanning the product to syncing data to the web application.</p>

        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p>To solve the challenge, I started with low-fidelity wireframes and rapid prototypes to test new workflows. The first iteration revealed that users completely missed a critical section of the form, which would have caused incomplete data entry. I iterated on the design, improving the visibility and flow of the form fields, and conducted another round of user testing to ensure the issue was resolved. After validating the workflow, I developed high-fidelity designs and a small design system, including colors, typography, and reusable components, to maintain consistency and make future iterations easier.</p>

        <h2>Final Solution</h2>
        <p>The final mobile application directly addressed the inefficiencies and errors in the previous process. Users can now scan swing tags quickly, have barcodes automatically extracted, complete the form accurately, and submit data to the web system with minimal effort. Key screens include the scanning interface, the auto-filled form with editable fields, and the submission confirmation screen that shows the sync status. The workflow is streamlined, efficient, and reduces errors, ensuring that product data is accurate and complete.</p>

        <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
        <p>By solving the challenge of inefficient data entry, the app reduced manual errors, improved completion of required fields, and sped up the workflow for team members. Users reported that the process felt faster and more intuitive, and the app quickly became the standard method for capturing product swing tag information. This project reinforced the importance of designing solutions that directly address user pain points, validating designs through usability testing, and creating a consistent design system for scalable and reliable UI.</p>
