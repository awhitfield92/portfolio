      <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This project focused on improving internal developer workflows by addressing recurring issues related to the creation and editing of JSON and YAML files, a task that despite being routine, was prone to frequent errors.</p>
      
      <h2>Discovery &amp; Research</h2>
      <p>Through observation and informal conversations, I identified a surprising pain point among developers: repeated typos, syntax errors, and formatting issues while manually creating or editing JSON and YAML files. While developers were familiar with the formats, the manual process was tedious and error-prone, especially under time pressure.</p>

          “I copy from old files and just hope it works after editing”
        </div>

          “It's too easy to make mistakes and hard to know where”

      <h2>Journey Mapping & Workflow Analysis</h2>
      <p>I mapped the existing user flows and pinpointed where inefficiencies existed. This clarified where time was being lost and where users were making mistakes.</p>
      
      <!-- <h2>Collaborative Ideation & Design Exploration</h2>
      <p>To better understand the workflow, I created user journey maps that captured how developers interacted with these files in their day-to-day tasks. I also developed user personas based on different levels of technical confidence and frequency of use.</p>

      <h2>User Research & Journey Mapping</h2>
      <p>To better understand the workflow, I created user journey maps that captured how developers interacted with these files in their day-to-day tasks. I also developed user personas based on different levels of technical confidence and frequency of use.</p>
      <p>From these insights, I crafted a guiding question to steer our design efforts.</p>
      <div class="hmw-speech">
        How might we improve the process of creating and editing JSON/YAML files to minimize errors?
      </div>

      <h2>Identifying Pain Points</h2>
      <p>By mapping out their processes, I was able to pinpoint where errors were occurring — most commonly during initial file creation and while making manual updates. These issues often led to delays, broken integrations, and unnecessary rework.</p>

      <h2>Solution Design</h2>
      <p>Based on the identified pain points, I designed a reusable form-based template to standardize JSON and YAML creation. The form guided developers through required fields, reduced the likelihood of typos, and automated consistent formatting.</p>

      <h2>Pilot & Rollout</h2>
      <p>I trialled the form with a small group of developers on the floor to gather early feedback and ensure it integrated smoothly into their existing workflows. Following a successful pilot, the template was adopted across the wider team.</p>

      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>The solution significantly reduced formatting errors and improved overall efficiency in creating structured data files. It also increased developer confidence by removing repetitive, error-prone tasks and replacing them with a structured, guided process.</p>
